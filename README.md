## 🗺️ Waypoints

Waypoints let you save and revisit custom locations easily:

- **Set a waypoint:** `/waypoint set home 100 64 200`
- **Remove a waypoint:** `/waypoint remove home`
- **Locate a waypoint:** `/waypoint locate home`
  - Gives you a glowing enchanted compass pointing to your waypoint
  - The compass disappears when you are within a configurable distance (default: `stop_distance` in config)
  - Tab completion for `/waypoint set` auto-suggests coordinates of the block you are looking at (like `/tp`)

Waypoints are saved per-player in the `Finddata` folder as JSON files.

## ⚙️ Configuration

```yaml
# FindBuddy Configuration
tracking:
  stop_distance: 25          # Distance when tracking stops
  notify_target: true        # Notify target when tracked
  require_requests: true     # Require permission requests
  request_timeout: 90        # Request timeout in seconds

compass:
  refresh_cooldown: 20       # Compass refresh cooldown in seconds
```

---

## 🔧 Permissions

```yaml
# Basic permissions
findbuddy.find:
  default: true
  description: "Allows using basic FindBuddy commands"

# Admin permissions
findbuddy.cleanup:
  default: op
  description: "Allows using cleanup commands"

# All permissions
findbuddy.*:
  default: op
  children:
    findbuddy.find: true
    findbuddy.cleanup: true
    findbuddy.waypoint: true

findbuddy.waypoint:
  default: true
  description: "Allows using waypoint commands"
```

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Player A** uses `/findbuddy locate PlayerB`
2. **System checks** if requests are required
3. **If direct tracking**: Player A gets a compass and starts tracking
4. **If requests required**: Player B gets a request to accept/decline
5. **Action bar shows** real-time distance and direction
6. **Compass points** to Player B's location

### Compass Features
- **Right-click** to refresh location (with cooldown)
- **Cannot be dropped** or moved to external inventories
- **Auto-removed** when tracking stops
- **Glows** with enchantment effect

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Compass not removed** | Use `/findbuddy cleanup <player>` |
| **Permission denied** | Check `findbuddy.find` permission |
| **Players can't track** | Verify `require_requests` setting |
| **Compass not working** | Check if players are in same world |
